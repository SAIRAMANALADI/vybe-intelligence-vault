## Summary
Relay is a local MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that consolidates 40 tools across 7 categories into a single binary, enabling unified file, image, PDF, web, and workflow management for AI agents and MCP clients.

## Key Features
- Single binary with 40 built-in tools across file, image, PDF, text, data, web, and workflow categories
- Supports both stdio and HTTP transport modes for MCP clients like Claude, Cursor, and VS Code
- Interactive TUI for setup, configuration, and tool exploration without manual JSON editing
- Security-hardened with protections against path traversal, SSRF, XSS, and prompt injection
- Enables advanced workflow tools (planning, research, branding) when paired with an Anthropic API key

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Relay eliminates the need to stitch together multiple single-purpose MCP servers, providing a unified, low-overhead toolkit that accelerates RAG and AI agent development with built-in file, image, and PDF processing capabilities.
