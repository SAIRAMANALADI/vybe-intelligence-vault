## Summary
Axon is a self-hosted RAG engine written in Rust that unifies the entire pipeline of crawling, scraping, ingesting, embedding, and querying data from diverse sources. It supports hybrid retrieval, cited LLM synthesis, and integrates with MCP, CLI, and REST interfaces for flexible access.

## Key Features
- Unified pipeline for all source types (web, local, Git, package registries, Reddit, YouTube, etc.) with a single durable job model in SQLite
- Hybrid retrieval and cited LLM synthesis over MCP, CLI, and REST interfaces
- Supports Incus system container (preferred) and bare-metal systemd deployments with GPU passthrough for TEI embeddings
- Vertical extractors for structured parsing of known sources (GitHub, PyPI, npm, Reddit, YouTube) and configurable chunking/embedding
- Built-in job management, watches, cleanup, and preflight checks for operational reliability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Axon provides a unified, production-ready RAG orchestration engine that simplifies the integration of diverse data sources, embeddings, and retrieval workflows for AI stack builders.
