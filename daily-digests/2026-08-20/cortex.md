## Summary
Cortex is a self-hosted log aggregation and investigation tool designed for homelabs and small private fleets. It aggregates syslog, Docker, OTLP, and AI transcripts into SQLite with FTS5 search, exposing data via MCP, CLI, and REST interfaces for operational intelligence and incident correlation.

## Key Features
- Unified ingestion pipeline for syslog, Docker, OTLP, and AI transcripts with normalization and enrichment
- SQLite with FTS5 for full-text search and bounded metadata storage
- Multiple interfaces: CLI, REST API, MCP, and a bundled investigation workspace
- Fleet intelligence with topology graphs, inventory, and host state correlation
- AI session indexing for Claude, Codex, and Gemini transcripts with incident clustering

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Cortex provides a lightweight, self-hosted solution for aggregating and correlating diverse operational and AI-generated logs, enabling RAG builders to integrate structured evidence and incident context directly into their AI workflows.
