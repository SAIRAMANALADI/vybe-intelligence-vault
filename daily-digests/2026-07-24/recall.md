## Summary
recall is a federated search tool that unifies queries across an agent's distributed knowledge stores (cortex, agent-hq, scout, lens) into a single token-budgeted briefing. It enables agents to load relevant context at the start of a task, avoiding redundant re-derivation of known information.

## Key Features
- Federates search across multiple knowledge stores (cortex, agent-hq, scout, lens) into a single query.
- Provides a token-budgeted briefing with normalized, ranked results from all available sources.
- Offers a web console (`recall serve`) for interactive exploration and a CLI for programmatic use.
- Supports MCP server integration for seamless agent workflows.
- Tracks new results since last query and allows saving frequent searches for persistent access.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
recall eliminates the friction of manually searching scattered knowledge stores, enabling agents to efficiently load relevant context at task initiation and avoid redundant re-derivation of known information.
