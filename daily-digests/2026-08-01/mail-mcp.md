## Summary
A draft-only IMAP helper for Thunderbird workflows, exposed as an MCP server and CLI tool. It enables searching, reading, and managing drafts with HTML and attachments, but does not send emails—drafts sync into Thunderbird for review and sending.

## Key Features
- MCP server for AI clients (Codex, Claude) to interact with mail via standardized tools
- CLI for manual mail operations (login, search, draft creation)
- Supports HTML drafts with attachments
- Secure secret handling via OS keyring (no plaintext storage)
- Shared Effect core for both MCP server and CLI functionality

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges AI workflows with Thunderbird's draft system, enabling secure, review-first email interactions for AI agents without sending emails directly.
