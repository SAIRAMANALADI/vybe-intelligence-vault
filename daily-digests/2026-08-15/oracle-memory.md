## Summary
Oracle Memory is a file-backed MCP memory server for AI agents that enables persistent, searchable memory across sessions without requiring a database. It combines BM25 keyword search, vector embeddings, and entity graphs for hybrid retrieval, while supporting structured memory types and atomic writes for data integrity.

## Key Features
- Hybrid search combining BM25 keyword, vector semantic, and entity graph ranking for high-precision recall
- Four structured memory types (fact, insight, chunk, working) with automatic TTL and session management
- Atomic writes and file-based storage for simplicity and data integrity without external databases
- Built-in benchmarking for retrieval quality and temporal correctness to ensure reliability
- Supports both stdio and HTTP transport modes with optional bearer token authentication

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Oracle Memory eliminates the need for external databases in AI agent memory systems while providing robust, hybrid search capabilities essential for RAG pipelines requiring persistent, session-spanning context.
