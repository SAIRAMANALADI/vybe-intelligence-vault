## Summary
A read-only Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Cosmos SDK chains that exposes RPC, gRPC, and LCD endpoints as tools for querying blockchain data. Designed to integrate with Hermes Agent for AI-driven tool discovery and execution.

## Key Features
- Read-only MCP server for Cosmos SDK chains with stdio transport
- Supports RPC, gRPC, and LCD endpoints with capability-based tool discovery
- Strict read-only enforcement via allowlists and query-service validation
- Dynamic gRPC calls through server reflection with timeouts and size limits
- Single binaries, container images, and environment variable configuration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Enables AI agents to securely query Cosmos SDK chains via standardized MCP tools, enhancing RAG pipelines with real-time blockchain data.
