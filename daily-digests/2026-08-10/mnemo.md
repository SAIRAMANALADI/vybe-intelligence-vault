## Summary
Mnemo is an on-prem, MCP-native embedded database designed for regulated AI deployments, offering cryptographically auditable memory primitives (REMEMBER, RECALL, FORGET, SHARE) with SHA-256 hash-chained write logs for tamper-evident verification. It supports DuckDB and PostgreSQL backends and integrates with AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Features
- SHA-256 hash-chained memory write logs for offline verification by external auditors
- MCP-native integration enabling AI agents to directly interact with memory primitives (REMEMBER, RECALL, FORGET, SHARE)
- Hybrid vector and lexical search with support for multiple embedders (e.g., nomic-embed-text, ONNX MiniLM)
- Regulatory compliance features for EU AI Act, India DPDP, and HIPAA with signed audit logs and consent records
- Measured security benchmarks against memory poisoning and tampering attacks (ASI06 compliance)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Mnemo provides a critical foundation for building trustworthy, auditable RAG systems in regulated environments by ensuring memory integrity and compliance without relying on hosted tiers.
