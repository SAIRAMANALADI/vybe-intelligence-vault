## Summary
A Rust-based MCP server and CLI for interacting with UniFi Network controllers, exposing REST-backed network operations (clients, devices, WLANs, health, alarms, events) via stdio or HTTP. It provides read and mutating actions for UniFi controllers while enforcing authorization scopes.

## Key Features
- Exposes 267 MCP actions (78 official, 175 internal, 8 preserved convenience) for UniFi controller operations
- Supports both stdio and HTTP MCP runtime surfaces for local and shared deployments
- Enforces authorization scopes (unifi:read for read actions, unifi:admin for mutating actions)
- Provides CLI parity with MCP actions for debugging and scripting
- Includes setup, verification, and health-check commands for runtime validation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely interact with UniFi network infrastructure via standardized MCP interfaces, bridging the gap between AI workflows and physical network management.
