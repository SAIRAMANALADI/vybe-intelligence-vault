## Summary
Anvil is a distributed object storage system designed for application state management, offering stable path-based storage with advanced coordination primitives like streaming writes, compare-and-swap, Zanzibar authorization, and materialized search indexes. It supports scalable, heterogeneous clusters with weighted placement and erasure coding for durability.

## Key Features
- Distributed object storage with stable paths and streaming writes
- Zanzibar-based authorization for fine-grained access control
- Materialized search indexes supporting vector, full-text, and hybrid queries
- Atomic programs for deterministic multi-path state transitions without transactions
- Heterogeneous cluster scaling with capacity-weighted rendezvous hashing and erasure coding

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Anvil provides a robust, scalable foundation for RAG systems requiring distributed state management, advanced indexing, and fine-grained authorization, reducing infrastructure complexity while ensuring data consistency and durability.
