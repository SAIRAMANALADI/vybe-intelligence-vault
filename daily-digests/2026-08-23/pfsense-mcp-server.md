## Summary
A security-first MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for pfSense that provides read-only, strongly typed access to pfSense appliances via AI assistants. It enables AI tools to query system, network, firewall, and diagnostic data without exposing mutation capabilities or raw shell access.

## Key Features
- 42 read-only MCP tools for pfSense introspection (system, network, firewall, services, users, certificates, diagnostics)
- Strict security model with zero write capabilities in production, enforced by static checks and capability gating
- Fail-closed configuration and strict TLS by default to prevent credential exposure
- Structured, typed tool contracts with capability-based access control
- Comprehensive documentation, threat modeling, and safety architecture (Tier 1 framework) for future write capabilities

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to safely query pfSense appliances for network monitoring and diagnostics without risking unintended network disruptions, aligning with security-first principles for RAG stack builders.
