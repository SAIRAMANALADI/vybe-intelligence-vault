## Summary
kern is a local-first RAG engine designed for Spec-Driven Development, parsing Markdown frontmatter into a deterministic ontology and vector index. It synchronizes entities, relations, and embeddings incrementally without external databases or GPUs, exposing functionality via MCP for AI agents.

## Key Features
- Deterministic parsing of Markdown frontmatter into typed entities and relations without LLM involvement
- Incremental synchronization of vector index and ontology via file diffs, avoiding full-corpus rebuilds
- Local-only operation with no external dependencies (no GPU, no cloud services)
- MCP server interface for seamless integration with AI agents like Claude Code
- Hybrid query routing between vector search and ontology graph traversal for optimal answers

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between vector search and relational understanding in RAG systems by leveraging structured frontmatter to build lightweight, local ontologies that AI agents can query efficiently without external infrastructure.
