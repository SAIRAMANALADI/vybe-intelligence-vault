## Summary
arcane-rmcp is a Rust-based MCP server and CLI that bridges Docker and Arcane API, enabling agents to manage Docker resources, Arcane environments, and system operations through MCP tools or direct shell commands.

## Key Features
- Exposes a single MCP tool (`arcane`) for managing Docker and Arcane resources via action/subaction dispatch
- Supports both stdio and HTTP MCP runtime surfaces for local and shared deployments
- Enforces destructive-operation confirmation and action scopes for safety
- Provides CLI parity with MCP tooling for scripting and debugging
- Includes authentication policies for HTTP MCP (bearer tokens, OAuth, loopback dev mode)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to safely and programmatically manage Docker and Arcane environments through standardized MCP interfaces, critical for RAG pipelines requiring dynamic resource orchestration.
