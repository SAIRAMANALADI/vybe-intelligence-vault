## Summary
A Rust-based MCP server and CLI for Gotify that enables agents to send push notifications, manage messages, and interact with Gotify's API via stdio or HTTP. It bridges MCP clients with Gotify's push notification system for AI-driven workflows.

## Key Features
- Exposes a single MCP tool (`gotify`) for managing Gotify resources (messages, apps, clients) and sending notifications
- Supports both stdio and HTTP transport for MCP clients (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
- CLI parity with MCP tooling for scripting and debugging
- Destructive actions require explicit confirmation for safety
- Supports static bearer tokens and OAuth via `lab-auth`

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to directly interact with Gotify's push notification system, streamlining real-time alerting and message management within AI-driven workflows.
