## Summary
This repository provides a standalone speculative execution layer for the Pi AI agent framework, enabling tool call prediction and safe execution routing without modifying Pi's core. It introduces Drafter and PatternAware for planning, canonicalizes actions for validation, and enforces strict isolation policies via execution worlds and effect transactions.

## Key Features
- Predictive tool execution with Drafter and PatternAware for planning future actions
- Strict isolation via layered execution worlds (runtime_sandbox, resource_snapshot, workspace_branch, Actor fallback)
- Canonical action identity (K(a)) for validation and lossless projection of tool semantics
- Provenance certificates for dynamic dependency validation and reuse of results
- Platform-aware policy enforcement with automatic fallback to safer routes on unsupported systems

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to safely predict and execute tool calls with rigorous isolation and provenance tracking, reducing latency and improving reliability in RAG pipelines.
