## Summary
Attest is a black-box consistency verifier for third-party LLM APIs that detects model substitution, downgrades, or dynamic routing by comparing behavioral fingerprints against a trusted reference baseline. It uses statistical testing (Jensen–Shannon divergence) to identify inconsistencies without relying on self-reported model identities or headers.

## Key Features
- Behavioral fingerprinting via empirical answer distributions (random numbers, colors, letters, etc.)
- Bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) for statistical comparison against reference baselines
- Per-model calibrated thresholds to avoid false positives/negatives
- Transport and parameter integrity checks (context truncation, tool call alterations, etc.)
- Reproducible evidence reports with confidence intervals and clear verdicts (consistent, incompatible, inconclusive, etc.)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Attest provides critical statistical evidence to verify that third-party LLM APIs serve the claimed models, preventing fraud, downgrades, or dynamic routing that could degrade RAG system reliability.
