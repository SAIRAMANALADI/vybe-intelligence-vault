## Summary
Hippocampus is an MCP server that provides decision memory for AI coding agents by recording, querying, and reasoning about architectural decisions in a repository. It enables agents to recall past decisions, dependencies, and trade-offs before making new choices.

## Key Features
- Records decisions as plain markdown files in `.decisions/records/` for version control and readability
- Provides five MCP tools (`query`, `log`, `classify`, `list`, `chain`) for decision retrieval and logging
- Supports decision graph traversal (inbound/outbound relationships) to understand dependencies and blast radius
- Offline-first with local embeddings and no external dependencies
- Validated against autonomous agents in a real-world TypeScript job processor scenario

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures AI agents make informed decisions by preserving institutional knowledge and reasoning about past architectural choices, reducing redundant debates and errors.
