## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for WhatsApp that enables reading, searching, and sending messages via the WhatsApp web multidevice API. This community fork fixes critical upstream issues, adds group management, security hardening, and contact name resolution while storing all data locally in SQLite databases.

## Key Features
- Direct WhatsApp account integration via web multidevice API using whatsmeow library
- Local SQLite storage for messages, contacts, and media with privacy-focused design
- Security hardening including REST API binding to localhost and mandatory authentication tokens
- Contact name resolution and LID migration fixes for accurate contact and message handling
- Group management tools (create_group, leave_group) and audio transcription (local/API) for searchable voice messages

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, local-first bridge to WhatsApp data for AI agents, enabling private, real-time access to messages and contacts while addressing critical upstream issues like contact resolution and security vulnerabilities.
