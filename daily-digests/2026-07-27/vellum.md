## Summary
vellum is a lightweight, self-hosted MCP server designed to manage a folder of markdown files as a personal or team knowledge vault. It provides a static Go binary with an embedded web UI and MCP capabilities, enabling agents to interact with markdown notes as resources or tools without requiring a database or embeddings.

## Key Features
- Static Go binary with embedded React SPA for a lightweight, portable vault
- MCP server exposing notes as resources and tools (15+ tools) for agent interaction
- Flat markdown storage with no database or embeddings, ensuring portability and no vendor lock-in
- Built-in OAuth 2.1 for secure authentication, with support for Claude and other MCP clients
- Curator tools for deterministic context preparation (e.g., tag suggestions, link recommendations) without LLM calls

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
vellum provides a simple, self-hosted way to manage markdown knowledge bases that agents can directly interact with via MCP, reducing complexity and lock-in for RAG pipelines.
