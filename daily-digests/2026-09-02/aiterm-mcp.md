## Summary
Aiterm-MCP provides a persistent MCP-native terminal that enables AI agents to programmatically launch and orchestrate other coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Codex CLI, Grok CLI) within a unified, multiplexed environment. It acts as a harness API for driving multiple AI tools through a single TUI, reducing context window overhead and enabling headless orchestration.

## Key Features
- Persistent MCP-native terminal for driving multiple AI agents (Claude, Codex, Grok, Cursor) in a single session
- Programmatic agent launching and steering via `agent_launch` and `agent_steer` tools
- Token-efficient PTY reads (~7.1x fewer tokens than raw logs) for reduced context window usage
- Cross-platform support (tmux on POSIX, psmux on native Windows) with session persistence
- In-place agent configuration (model/effort changes) without restarting sessions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Aiterm-MCP enables AI orchestrators to programmatically spawn and steer multiple coding agents within a single persistent terminal, eliminating the need for manual terminal management and reducing context window overhead for RAG systems.
