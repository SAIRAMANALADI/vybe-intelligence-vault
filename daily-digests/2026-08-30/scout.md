## Summary
Scout is a zero-dependency web reader that fetches URLs and converts raw HTML into clean, readable markdown, typically reducing content size by ~90%. It caches pages for instant re-reads, enables searchable reading history, and integrates with other tools like Cortex for knowledge management.

## Key Features
- Converts raw HTML to clean markdown with ~90% size reduction
- Caches pages for instant re-reads and searchable history
- CLI and MCP server for agent integration
- Built-in SQLite FTS5 search for reading history
- Reading room web interface for browsing cached content

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Scout drastically reduces token costs for RAG pipelines by converting web content into clean, searchable markdown while caching results for reuse, making it essential for efficient web-based knowledge ingestion.
