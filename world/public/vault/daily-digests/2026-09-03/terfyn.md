## Summary
Terfyn is a statically analyzable, capability-oriented execution platform for nondeterministic programs that enables plan-time review of authority grants and effect bounds before deployment. It provides a resource graph-based governance layer for agent systems, allowing teams to diff capabilities, enforce policies, and audit executions locally.

## Key Features
- Plan-time authority diffing and effect bounding for autonomous agents before execution
- Declarative resource graph with policy enforcement (budgets, approvals, tool rules)
- Local-first execution with SQLite-based deployment state tracking and audit chains
- Support for control-flow workflows (conditionals, loops, dynamic fan-out) via `.agent` language
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval gates for sensitive tool operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Terfyn provides a critical governance layer for RAG/AI stacks by enabling pre-deployment review of agent capabilities and authority, reducing risk of unintended actions while maintaining local-first control.
