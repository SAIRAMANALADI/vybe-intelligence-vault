## Summary
Filesystem MCP provides secure, token-optimized filesystem operations for AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling batch reads, surgical edits, and project-root confined file operations without shell spawn overhead.

## Key Features
- Batch file operations (read/write/edit) in a single MCP call to reduce token usage and latency
- Project-root confinement with path traversal protection and Zod-validated arguments
- 13+ MCP tools for file manipulation, search, metadata inspection, and permissions management
- Docker-ready deployment with multi-arch native binary support for performance
- Structured success/failure responses per file to ensure reliability in agent workflows

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to safely and efficiently perform filesystem operations in batch, reducing token costs and latency while maintaining project-root security, which is critical for RAG and agent-based workflows.
