## Summary
agent-ops provides secure infrastructure for AI agents and human operators to manage Linux hosts via persistent terminal sessions, full-chain audit logging, and MCP-native interfaces. It bridges AI agents and humans with a dual-channel architecture (MCP for AI, CLI PTY passthrough for humans) while ensuring reliability, auditability, and security.

## Key Features
- Persistent terminal sessions via rmux for reliable long-running tasks and uninterrupted operations
- Dual-channel architecture: MCP interface for AI agents and CLI PTY passthrough for human operators
- Full-chain audit logging with SQLite for compliance and traceability of all operations
- Multi-host orchestration with group/tag filtering and broadcast operations for scalable management
- Secure deployment with Bridge proxy, token authentication, TLS encryption, and exec safety checks to prevent command injection

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the critical gap between AI agent prototypes and production-ready infrastructure by providing persistent, auditable, and secure terminal access for both AI and human operators, enabling reliable and compliant AI-driven operations on Linux hosts.
