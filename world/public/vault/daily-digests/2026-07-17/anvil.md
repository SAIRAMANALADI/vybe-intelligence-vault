## Summary
Anvil provides a secure, isolated Docker sandbox for agents to execute code or shell commands in resource-limited, network-isolated containers, returning structured results like stdout, stderr, exit codes, and execution metrics. It includes a CLI, a web dashboard for run history, and an MCP server for agent integration.

## Key Features
- Secure, ephemeral Docker containers with network isolation and resource limits
- Structured output including stdout, stderr, exit codes, and execution metrics
- CLI and web dashboard for run history, comparison, and management
- MCP server for seamless agent integration
- Zero npm dependencies, driving Docker CLI directly

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Anvil enables agents to safely execute untrusted code in isolated environments, reducing security risks while providing verifiable, reproducible results essential for RAG and AI workflows.
