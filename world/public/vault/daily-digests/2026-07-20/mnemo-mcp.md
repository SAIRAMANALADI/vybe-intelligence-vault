## Summary
Mnemo MCP Server provides persistent AI memory with hybrid search, embedded synchronization, and temporal knowledge graph capabilities. It enables AI agents to capture, retrieve, and manage long-term memory with advanced features like entity resolution, LLM-driven compression, and cross-machine sync.

## Key Features
- Hybrid retrieval combining full-text search (FTS5) and vector search (sqlite-vec) with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and cross-encoder reranking
- Temporal knowledge graph with bitemporal columns for time-travel queries and entity resolution via embedding KNN
- LLM-driven memory compression (~3x token reduction) and importance-based soft-archive policies
- Multi-machine sync with E2E-encrypted passport bundles (AES-256-GCM) supporting S3, R2, B2, MinIO, and Google Drive backends
- Plugin trinity (recall-context, memory-commit skills) and proactive memory capture for AI agents

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Mnemo MCP is essential for RAG builders as it provides a robust, self-hostable solution for persistent AI memory with advanced retrieval, compression, and synchronization capabilities, enabling long-term context retention and cross-session continuity.
