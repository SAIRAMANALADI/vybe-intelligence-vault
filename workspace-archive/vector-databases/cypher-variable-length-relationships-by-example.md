## Summary

- **Variable-length relationships in Cypher** allow traversal of paths with dynamic depth using syntax like `-[:REL_TYPE*min..max]->`, where `min` and `max` define the range of hops (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` for 2-3 hops).
- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) enable matching nodes without traversing relationships, useful for binding variables to the same node (e.g., `-[:LAST_POST]->()-[:PREVIOUS_POST*0..1]->(post)`).
- **Performance considerations** require explicit length limits (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*..5]

## Use Cases

- Semantic search store
- Document embedding indices
- Memory vector caches
