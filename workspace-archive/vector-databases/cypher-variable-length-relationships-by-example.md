## Summary

- **Variable-length relationship syntax in Cypher** allows specifying path lengths using `*minHops..maxHops` (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` for 2-3 hops), enabling flexible traversal depth control in graph queries.

- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) bind the same node to multiple variables in a pattern, simplifying queries for nodes with optional relationships (e.g., retrieving all blog posts regardless of count).

- **Performance considerations** dictate avoiding infinite-length paths (`*`) in producti

## Use Cases

- Semantic search store
- Document embedding indices
- Memory vector caches
