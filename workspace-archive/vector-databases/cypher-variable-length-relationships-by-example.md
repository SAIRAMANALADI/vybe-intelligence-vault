## Summary

- **Variable-length relationships in Cypher** are defined using the `*n..m` syntax, where `n` is the minimum and `m` the maximum path length (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` matches paths with 2 or 3 `KNOWS` relationships).
- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) allow binding a node to itself, enabling queries to include nodes even when no relationships exist (e.g., `-[:PREVIOUS_POST*0..1]->` ensures all friends' posts are returned, regardless of count).
- **Performance considerations** necessitate explicit le

## Use Cases
