## Summary

- **Variable-length relationship syntax** in Cypher allows path traversal with dynamic depth using `*min..max` notation (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` for 2-3 hops), enabling flexible graph traversal without hardcoding path lengths.

- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) bind a node to itself, useful for unifying results in queries where optional relationships may or may not exist (e.g., combining `LAST_POST` and `PREVIOUS_POST` into a single collection).

- **Performance considerations** require explicit l

## Use Cases

- Semantic search store
- Document embedding indices
- Memory vector caches
