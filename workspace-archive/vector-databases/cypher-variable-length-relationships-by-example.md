## Summary

- **Variable-length relationship syntax** in Cypher allows specifying path lengths using `*min..max` (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` for 2-3 hops) or `*` for unbounded traversal, enabling flexible graph traversal patterns.

- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) bind a node to itself, useful for unifying results in queries where optional relationships may or may not exist (e.g., matching blog posts regardless of prior/next links).

- **Performance considerations** require explicit length limits (`..max`) in u

## Use Cases

- Semantic search store
- Document embedding indices
- Memory vector caches
