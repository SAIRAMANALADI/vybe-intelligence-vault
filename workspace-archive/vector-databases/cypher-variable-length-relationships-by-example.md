# Cypher: Variable-length relationships by example

  - Valuable developer reference

## Summary

- **Variable-length relationship syntax** in Cypher uses `-[REL_TYPE*min..max]->` where `min` and `max` define path length bounds; `*2` matches exactly 2 hops, `*2..3` matches 2-3 hops, and `*` matches any length (with performance caveats).

- **Zero-length paths** (`-[REL_TYPE*0..1]->`) bind the same node to both ends of the pattern, enabling conditional traversal without `OPTIONAL MATCH`; e.g., `()-[:LAST_POST]->()-[:PREVIOUS_POST*0..1]->(post)` captures all posts regardless of prior relations

## Use Cases

- Semantic search store
- Document embedding indices
- Memory vector caches
