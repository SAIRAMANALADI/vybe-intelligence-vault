## Summary

- **Variable-length relationship syntax** in Cypher allows path traversal with explicit or unbounded depth using `*minHops..maxHops` notation (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` for 2-3 hops, `-[:KNOWS*]->` for infinite hops with caution).

- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) enable binding a node to itself, simplifying queries where optional relationships may not exist (e.g., `(friend)-[:LAST_POST]->()-[:PREVIOUS_POST*0..1]->(post)`).

- **Performance considerations** dictate avoiding infinite-length paths (`

## Use Cases

- Knowledge querying
- Document summarization
- Hybrid retrieval
