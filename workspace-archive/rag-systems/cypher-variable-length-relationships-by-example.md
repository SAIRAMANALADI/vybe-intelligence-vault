## Summary

- **Variable-length path syntax in Cypher** enables traversal of relationships with dynamic depth using `*min..max` notation (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->`), where `min` and `max` define inclusive bounds; omitting bounds defaults to `*1` (single relationship).
- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) bind the same node to both start and end variables, simplifying queries for optional relationships (e.g., `()-[:REL*0..1]->()` captures nodes with/without outgoing relationships uniformly).
- **Performance conside

## Use Cases

- Knowledge querying
- Document summarization
- Hybrid retrieval
