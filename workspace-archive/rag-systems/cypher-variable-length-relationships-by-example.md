## Summary

- **Variable-length relationships in Cypher** allow path traversal with dynamic depth using `*min..max` syntax (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` for 2-3 hops), enabling flexible graph traversal without manual multi-hop queries.
- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) bind the same node to multiple variables in a single pattern, simplifying queries for nodes with optional relationships (e.g., `()-[:REL*0..1]->(n)` captures nodes with/without the relationship uniformly).
- **Performance considerations** require ex

## Use Cases

- Knowledge querying
- Document summarization
- Hybrid retrieval
