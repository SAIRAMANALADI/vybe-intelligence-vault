## Summary

- **Variable-length relationships in Cypher** are specified using the `*n..m` syntax, where `n` is the minimum and `m` the maximum path length (e.g., `-[:KNOWS*2..3]->` matches paths with 2 or 3 `KNOWS` relationships).

- **Zero-length paths** (`*0`) allow binding a variable to the same node, simplifying queries where optional relationships may not exist (e.g., `-[:PREVIOUS_POST*0..1]->` includes cases with no prior posts).

- **Performance considerations** require avoiding infinite-length paths

## Use Cases

- Knowledge querying
- Document summarization
- Hybrid retrieval
